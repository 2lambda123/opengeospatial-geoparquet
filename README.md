# Cloud Data Warehouse Geospatial Interoperability

## About

This repository is the main record of a collaboration to better standardize the import and export of geospatial information on 'Cloud Data Warehouses'.

## Background

Most Cloud Data Warehouses (BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift, etc) have at least some level of geospatial support, but all handle the import and export 
in slightly different ways, requiring users do advanced spatial ETL to take it from one and load it in another. For the most part all support some 
sort of standard (WKT, WKB, EWKT, GeoJSON), but all handle it in slightly different ways. 

OGC is helping to convene a small group of key participants to provide leadership to the industry, aligning on the interoperable formats so that 
geospatial information can flow between the various systems with ease.
